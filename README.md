# BizCardX_Extracting_Business_Card_Data

#### Objective of the project is to make a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.

## Technologies:
#### OCR,streamlit GUI, SQL,Data Extraction

## Approach:
1. Installed Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and database management system MySQL.
2. Designed the user interface using Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
`  card image and extracting its information.
3. Implemented the OCR and image processing with python RegEx for extracting Card holder Name, mobile No., email ids, website link etc &  "Coordinate Algorithm" for     extracting company name & location of the company.
4. Displayed the extracted information on the application page.
5. Used Mysql to store extracted data into the database. enables users to Update and  delete the data through the streamlit UI.
6. Tested the application to check application is running properly or not.
7. Improved the application by adding countinuously features.

 ## Challenges that I have faced during making project:
1. Getting data from image using easyOCR
2. Differentiating different types of data like email id, mobile No., Card Holder Name, website Name from extracted data because sometimes extracted data was not in 
   expecting format for email id, mobile No., website link.
3. Extracting Company Name and Location of Company from card and differentiating them. I solved it using own "Coordinate Algorithm".
4. Displaying the information on the application page.
5. Writing MYSQL query to create table, storing data in the table, fatching all stored information from table.

## Handled all challenges:
I have done my project with my hard working & curiocity of learning new things.
